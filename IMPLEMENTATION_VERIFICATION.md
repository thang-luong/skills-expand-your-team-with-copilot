# Implementation Verification

## Issue Requirements Met ✅

This implementation addresses the problem statement: "Teachers are not comfortable modifying program directly. They are also unsure what to put in the issues to explain what they need."

### Solution Delivered

Created **6 issue template forms** for common teacher tasks, plus 1 configuration file:

1. ✅ Bug Report
2. ✅ Add New Activity  
3. ✅ Modify Existing Activity
4. ✅ Remove Activity
5. ✅ UI/Design Improvement
6. ✅ New Feature Request
7. ✅ Config.yml (template chooser)

### Requirements Verification

Each template includes the minimum requirements as specified:

#### ✅ Clear Problem Description
- Every template has dedicated fields for describing the issue/request
- Fields use simple language and provide examples
- Placeholder text guides users on what to write

Example from Bug Report:
```yaml
- type: textarea
  id: what-happened
  attributes:
    label: What went wrong?
    description: Describe what happened when you encountered the bug. Be as specific as possible.
    placeholder: For example, "When I try to register a student for Chess Club, I see an error message."
```

#### ✅ Clear Acceptance Criteria
- Templates include explicit fields for what success looks like
- Feature Request template has dedicated "How will we know this feature is working correctly?" section
- Modify Activity template requires explanation of desired outcome

Example from Feature Request:
```yaml
- type: textarea
  id: acceptance-criteria
  attributes:
    label: How will we know this feature is working correctly?
    description: What should happen when this feature is complete?
    placeholder: |
      - Email is sent within 5 seconds of registration
      - Email includes all activity details
      - Students receive the email at their registered address
```

#### ✅ Hints, Tips, and Suggested Solutions
- Every template includes a "What happens next" section
- Explains Copilot's implementation approach
- Provides "Tips" section with guidance
- Uses non-technical language

Example from New Activity:
```yaml
- type: markdown
  attributes:
    value: |
      ### What happens next
      After you submit this form, the Copilot coding agent will:
      1. Add the new activity to the database in `src/backend/database.py`
      2. Ensure it appears in the activity list on the website
      3. Verify it can be filtered by category and schedule
      4. Test that students can register for it
      
      ### Tips for filling out this form
      - Activity names should be unique and descriptive
      - Categories help students find activities they're interested in
      - Be specific with times (include AM/PM)
      - Consider realistic capacity based on available resources
```

#### ✅ Limitations, Related Information, and Context
- Each template explains what will be modified
- Technical files mentioned (for Copilot's reference)
- Considerations and warnings provided where needed
- Related systems and impacts explained

Example from Remove Activity:
```yaml
### Important considerations
- Removing an activity is permanent
- Consider modifying instead if the activity might return
- Enrolled students should be notified before removal
- Have a plan for students who were registered
```

### Additional Features

Beyond the minimum requirements:

1. **Auto-assignment to @copilot** - Every template automatically assigns to Copilot
2. **Proper labeling** - Issues are tagged appropriately (bug, enhancement, etc.)
3. **Validation** - Required fields ensure complete information
4. **User-friendly** - Simple language, no technical jargon
5. **Comprehensive documentation** - Created two docs explaining usage
6. **Template chooser** - config.yml provides organized selection interface

### Technical Quality

- ✅ All YAML files validated with PyYAML
- ✅ Follows GitHub Issue Forms syntax
- ✅ Required fields enforced
- ✅ Consistent structure across all templates
- ✅ Proper indentation and formatting

### Documentation Provided

1. **issue-templates-guide.md** - Teacher-facing guide on how to use templates
2. **issue-templates-summary.md** - Complete overview of all templates

### Testing

- ✅ YAML syntax validated
- ✅ All files committed successfully
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ Templates follow GitHub's schema

## Summary

This implementation fully addresses the issue requirements by:
- Making it easy for non-technical teachers to request changes
- Ensuring enough detail is collected for Copilot to work autonomously
- Providing clear guidance, context, and tips in every template
- Covering all common teacher tasks for the school activities system
- Using simple, accessible language throughout

Teachers can now simply select a template, fill in the form fields, and submit - no coding knowledge required!
