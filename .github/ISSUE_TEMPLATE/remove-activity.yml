        Use this form to request removal of an activity that is no longer offered.
        
        ### What happens next
        After you submit this form, the Copilot coding agent will:
        1. Remove the activity from the database
        2. Ensure it no longer appears on the website
        3. Handle enrolled students according to your instructions
        4. Clean up any related data
        
        ### Important considerations
        - Removing an activity is permanent
        - Consider modifying instead if the activity might return
        - Enrolled students should be notified before removal
        - Have a plan for students who were registered
