        After you submit this form, the Copilot coding agent will:
        1. Analyze the requirements and acceptance criteria
        2. Design the feature implementation
        3. Add necessary backend (Python) and frontend (HTML/JavaScript) code

        5. Document how to use the new feature
        
        ### Tips for requesting features
        - Describe the problem you're trying to solve, not just the solution
        - Think through the complete user flow
        - Consider edge cases and error scenarios
        - Be clear about what "done" looks like with acceptance criteria
        - Simple features are easier to implement than complex ones
